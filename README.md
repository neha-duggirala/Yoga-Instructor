# Yoga-Instructor

## Introduction
It uses a machine learning model called PoseNet which is a machine learning model that allows for Real-time Human Pose Estimation and overlay a skeleton stick figure on top.


## Motivation
The body is the most complex biochemical factory we know of & learning how to engineer it allows us to enter sense modalities at will. 
We are all caught up in the rat race. Our mind, soul, and body need to experience a deep fulfilling joy free from all the worldly tensions. The first solution that pops up is *YOGA*.
yoga is associated with the culture and heritage of India. In Sanskrit, yoga means *to unite* and describes a way to live a healthy life. This may be a difficult practice not necessarily fun but the benefits from it are worth it.
Our project is to motivate society to practice yoga by conceiving, designing, and building the prototype for a yoga instructor.
